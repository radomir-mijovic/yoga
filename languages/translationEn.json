      "title1": "1. Yoga makes you feel better",
      "text1": "It’s a simple as that and it is why so many people get hooked on yoga. You will always feel better after a yoga class. Of course, if you start with an advanced class while still a beginner, you might end up feeling frustrated. But pick a suitable class for your level and go in with an open mind and you will feel different, better, more open, present and happier. If you don’t believe me, try it…",
      "title2": "2. Yoga makes your body strong, supple and healthy",
      "text2": "Of course, you need to give it a chance but most people start feeling some of the physical benefits of yoga during their first class. In time (maybe shorter than you think!) your flexibility will increase, your fitness levels improve, your muscles will grow stronger and you’ll become more supple. The amount will vary depending on the style you choose. I recommend starting with Hatha yoga as this is the root of most styles of yoga. As your body gets stronger your mind will too. You will feel more self-confident and stronger in yourself.",
      "title3": "3. Yoga helps you quieten your mind, makes you feel calm",
      "text3": "After a yoga class I always find my state of mind has shifted. It’s like I have had a spring clean in my head. Some things have fallen into place, some things are just not there anymore at all, or I have a completely different perspective on stuff. Overall I am in a much quieter place. This helps me with the next reason to practice…",
      "title4": "4. Yoga helps you to stay focused",
      "text4": "Because your mind will be quieter and clutter-free it is easier to direct the energy to where you want it to go. Yoga mostly moves me from being all over the place, to being able to focus on one thing again. In yoga they say you develop one-pointedness concentration through practice. I can say for sure that it really does happen. You train the mind to become aware and present. Research has even shown that after a yoga class you are generally better able to focus your mental resources, process information more accurately and also learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively. How about that!",
      "title5": "5. Yoga helps you to accept whatever life brings to your table",
      "text5": "Life experiences are not always positive. Difficult things happen to us all and sometimes we will be in pain. Yoga has taught me that everything changes. Both the positive but also the painful things in life come and go. Knowing this and understanding this on a deeper level makes it easier to accept and stay present and positive, also through the hard times.",
      "title6": "6. Yoga helps you to make better choices",
      "text6": "Becoming healthier and experiencing all the benefits of yoga will make you more aware and able to choose things in life that support this positive journey. You will slowly become more aware how things influence you. You will find you naturally want to make changes to your diet, choosing foods which support your health and yoga practice. You may see this in your friendship groups too, spending more time with friends who have a positive influence, having more strength to move away from negative situations.",
      "title7": "7. Yoga makes you more aware",
      "text7": "So yeah! That is the gist of it. You will become more aware of everything, who you really are, your tendencies, life, what is good for you and not so good for you, what you really want and what is important to you. As you develop self-awareness you are able to change thoughts and interpretations you make in your mind. Changing the interpretations in your mind allows you to change your emotions. Self-awareness is one of the attributes of Emotional Intelligence and an important factor in achieving success in different areas of your life."
