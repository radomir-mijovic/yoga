In time (maybe shorter than you think!) your flexibility will increase, your fitness levels improve, your muscles will grow stronger and you’ll become more supple. The amount will vary depending on the style you choose. I recommend starting with Hatha yoga as this is the root of most styles of yoga. As your body gets stronger your mind will too. You will feel more self-confident and stronger in yourself."

Yoga mostly moves me from being all over the place, to being able to focus on one thing again. In yoga they say you develop one-pointedness concentration through practice. I can say for sure that it really does happen. You train the mind to become aware and present. Research has even shown that after a yoga class you are generally better able to focus your mental resources, process information more accurately and also learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively. How about that!"

You will slowly become more aware how things influence you. You will find you naturally want to make changes to your diet, choosing foods which support your health and yoga practice. You may see this in your friendship groups too, spending more time with friends who have a positive influence, having more strength to move away from negative situations."

You will become more aware of everything, who you really are, your tendencies, life, what is good for you and not so good for you, what you really want and what is important to you. As you develop self-awareness you are able to change thoughts and interpretations you make in your mind. Changing the interpretations in your mind allows you to change your emotions. Self-awareness is one of the attributes of Emotional Intelligence and an important factor in achieving success in different areas of your life."
